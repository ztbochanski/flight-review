Impulsivity- do it fast, not so fast think first. Macho- I can do it, taking chances is foolish. Anti authority- rules don't apply to me, rules made for a reason. Invulnerable- it won't happen to me, it could happen to me. Resignation- what's the use, I'm not helpless.

Inversion climb to straight an level feels like tumbling back, Coriolis moving head in a long constant rate turn will feel like turning on a different axis, elevator updraft feel like nose up attitude you will push down, false horizon sloped clouds or lights will make you think the horizon is different an will try to align on it, leans long constant rate turn feels like level an when turning to level feel like a bank the opposite so you lean back, autokinesis stationary light appears to move an will try to Orient on it, graveyard spiral like leans but you notice you lose alt turning back to what feels like level an pull up to keep alt deepening the spiral, somatogravic accel feel like nose up vice versa decel.

Narrow upslope will fly lower think higher, wider downslope will fly higher think lower. Nil wdh

Ruaspi, radiation calm clear night radiation cools air around to dew point, upslope air force up slope by wind adiabatically cool to dew point, advection fog warm moist air from ocean blown over cold coast dew point req wind, steam fog cold dry air over warm humid water saturated to limit, precip fog warm rainfall into cold airmass saturates to dew point, ice fog when dew point is below freezing.

Torque opposite reaction of prop, spiral slipstream spins an yaws to left, p factor descending blade has greater aoa into the wind an ascending blade has tailwind more thrust on right, precession force felt 90 after an ahead in the rotation up yaw right down yaw left.

Lift Bernoulli an newton Law equal opposite reaction.

Parasite drags skin friction small holes not completely smooth surface air catches, form drag antennas and landings gear, interference drag different airflows wing root turbulent air not laminar.
Induced drag byproduct of lift high press air will curve around wingtip to get to low on top spiraling
