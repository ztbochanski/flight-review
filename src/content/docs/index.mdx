ATOMATOFLAMES

RUASPI

Left turning tendencies (bycile wheel anology)
PAST
precession - video (gyroscopic precession)[https://youtu.be/P3smLuTr0Fk?t=82]
asymmetric thrust (p-factor) decending blade has higher angle of attack
spiraling slipstream
torque (newtons 3rd law)

Torque opposite reaction of prop,
spiral slipstream spins an yaws to left,
p factor descending blade has greater aoa into the wind an
ascending blade has tailwind more thrust on right,
precession force felt 90 after an ahead in the rotation up
yaw right down yaw left.

Parasite drags skin friction small holes not completely smooth surface air catches,
form drag antennas and landings gear,
interference drag different airflows wing root turbulent air not laminar.
Induced drag byproduct of lift high press air will curve
around wingtip to get to low on top spiraling

Type certificate data sheet everything the plane needs to be air worthy.

Common carriage, hold out, compensation, point to point, people cargo. Needs air carrier cert

Weight shift weight x distance from old arm to new arm/total weight equal change in cg.
Weight add x distance from cg to location/new total weight equal change

Low in up left, high out down right. Cold front showery, good vis turbulent, warm front stratiform bad vis not turbulent steady precip. Occluded very cold catch up to warm behind cool front. Or cool front warm an colder front

Ocean breeze to land in day because land is hotter less dense air replace by colder dense ocean air. Reverse at night warmer ocean air.

Tstorm cumulus mature dissipate moisture lifting action instability

Moa, controlled firing, prohibit, restrict, alert, warning, nation security area. Temp flight restriction. Mtr 4 number below 1500agl 3 number above 1500agl

Golf 1200 below 1 coc, above 1200 1 152 night 3 152 above 10k 5 111 bravo 3 coc

No deco stop below 8k 12 hours, deco stop 24 hours, above 8k 24hours
