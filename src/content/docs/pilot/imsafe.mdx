## Aeronautical Decision Making Definition (PHAK 17)

A systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management. The two defining elements of ADM are
hazard and risk.

## Risk Mitigation

**I**llness - Am I sick?<br></br>
**M**edication - Am I taking any medication? If so, have I discussed with my AME if it is safe for flight?<br></br>
**S**tress - Am I under psychological stress? School/Work? Money? Health? Family/Social life?<br></br>
**A**lcohol - Have I been drinking within the previous 8 hours? Am I still experiencing the effect of alcohol?<br></br>
**F**atigue - Have I gotten adequate rest?<br></br>
**E**ating - Am I hungry?<br></br>

## 5 P's

Pilot - physical fitness, currency, and proficiency<br></br>
Passengers - Are they fit to fly? Are they comfortable flying?<br></br>
Plane - Airworthiness and documentation<br></br>
Programming - Are you proficient using the avionics? Are the GPS databases up to date?<br></br>
