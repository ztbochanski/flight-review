## In-flight illusions ICEFLAGS (AIM 8-1-5) (PHAK 16-6)

**Inversion** - Abrupt change in altitude creates the illusion of tumbling backwards<br></br>
**Coriolis** - Rapid head movement causes the illusion of accelerating or turning<br></br>
**Elevator** - An updraft causes the pilot to think that aircraft is in a climb. Pilot reacts by forcing the nose down inducing a dive.<br></br>
**False Horizon** - Sloping cloud formations or obscured horizons confuse the pilot into misaligning with the horizon.<br></br>
**Leans** - Abrupt recovery from a roll can mislead pilot into thinking aircraft is in a turn in the opposite direction.<br></br>
**Autokinesis** - At night, stationary lights may appear to be in motion. Pilot may lose control of aircraft trying to align it with “moving” light.<br></br>
**Graveyard Spiral** - In a prolonged constant rate turn, sensation of the turn is not felt. In recovery to straight and level, the pilot may sense a turn in the opposite direction and pull back on the yoke, only tightening the spiral.<br></br>
**Somatogravic** - Rapid acceleration causes the illusion of the being in a nose up attitude. Rapid deceleration will have the opposite effect.<br></br>

## Body systems for orientation and movement inspace (PHAK 16-5)

- **Vestibular** - The inner ear system composed of 3 semicircular hollow but fluid filled canals arranged in the `pitch`, `roll`, and `yaw` axes.
  - This endolymph fluid inside the canals moves when the head or body moves and displaces tiny hair cells that stimulate nerve impulses. These signals are then sent to the brain and interpreted as motion.
- **Somatosensory** - The nerves in our skin cells.
  - The sensations of motion that we feel in our bodies from acceleration or turning.
- **Visual** - Our Eyes
  - Light enters the eyeball through the cornea, travels through the lens and falls on the photoreceptors
    of the retina. The two kinds of photoreceptors are rods and cones. Rods are used for night and
    peripheral vision while cones are used to sense color.

## Mitgate middle ear pain (PHAK 16-4)

- Air inside of the middle ear is normally equalized through the Eustachian tube: a tube that travels
  from the ear to the back of the throat on each side. If there is any kind of congestion or blockage it
  makes this equalization difficult or impossible. In a climb, the air outside becomes less dense and
  the trapped higher pressure air in the middle ear tends to expand. In a descent, the trapped air is of
  lower pressure than the outside air and feeling of compression is experienced. This is typically
  more painful and more difficult to resolve. Sinus congestions cause pain from similar
  circumstances and can be very painful.
- The first step in avoiding this pain is to not fly with head
  colds or ear/sinus infections. In flight, equalization can be helped along by swallowing, yawning,
  tensing the throat muscles, or by executing the Valsalva maneuver. This is accomplished by pinching the nostrils, closing the mouth, and attempting to exhale.
- Oral decongestions do not provide adequate relief and may have adverse side effects.

## Types of Hypoxia (AIM 8-1-2) (PHAK 16-2)

Hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body. It is occurs at 4 different levels

- **Lung:** Hypoxic Hypoxia

  - Oxygen is not available at adequate pressure for the lungs to absorb. This occurs when we climb
    higher in altitude and the air becomes less dense.

- **Blood:** Hypemic
  - This is the inability of the red blood cells to carry oxygen to the other cells. The most common
    cause in aviation is carbon monoxide poisoning especially with small piston aircraft. Cabin heat is
    provided by ducting engine heat from the exhaust manifold into the cockpit. If there is any kind of
    leak in this system, exhaust fumes containing carbon monoxide will enter the cockpit as well.
    Carbon dioxide molecules bond to the hemoglobin in red blood cells 200x faster than oxygen
    molecules, leaving no more room for the blood cells to carry the oxygen. Other causes of this
    type of hypoxia include anemia (a sickness caused by lowered hemoglobin) or donating blood.
- **Cell:** Histotoxic

  - This is the cells’ (other than blood cells) inability to use the available oxygen. Using drugs or
    alcohol can cause this. When using even over-the-counter medicine, consult an AME to see if it is
    okay for use in flight.

- **Transport:** Stagnant
  - Inability of oxygen to reach cells because of poor circulation. The most common form of this in
    aviation is when the body experiences excessive G-forces.

### Symptoms of Hypoxia

- Poor judgement, visual acuity and coordination.
- Sensation of euphoria.
- Dizziness, headache, drowsiness and cyanosis (blue coloration of lips and fingernails).
