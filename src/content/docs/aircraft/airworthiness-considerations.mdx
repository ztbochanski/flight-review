### Does an Airworthiness Certificate ever expire?

Not as long as inspections are kept up to date and manufacturer's original design is adhered to

> FAR 91.9, “...no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating
> limitations specified in the approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual...”
